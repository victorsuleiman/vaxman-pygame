### Vax-man in Python with PyGame

![Pacman Game Window](https://github.com/victorsuleiman/vaxman-pygame/blob/master/images/vaxman.jpg?raw=true)

Exercise on software refactoring: modified Pac-man game developed in Python, implementing different rules and game conditions from the original project (which was forked). Different from the original Pac-man rules, on this game, the ghosts became viruses and pac-man's mission is to eat them before they accumulate to a certain number and the game is over. During development of this little project, I've Learned multiple PyGame concepts such as game loop functionality, surface drawing, sprite colliding, among others, while also improving general Python skills and reading abilities on non-self-written code and understanding framework concepts hands-on while rewriting it.
